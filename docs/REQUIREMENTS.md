# Requirements and acceptance criteria

Status: **proposed v1 requirements**, not implemented functionality. "Must" below is a release gate. The current preview demonstrates only the subset listed in [verification](VERIFICATION.md).

## Core journey

| ID | Requirement | Measurable acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AUTH-01 | Connect using approved browser/device authorization and Keychain storage | A cancelled or expired flow returns to signed-out state without tokens or an installable library; test both before/after browser return. Successful connection requires nonempty validated credentials and correct audience, not exit 0. |
| AUTH-02 | Explicit disconnect and refresh ownership | Disconnect clears account credentials, closes account-scoped jobs safely and labels cached data unavailable; account B never inherits account A's entitlement. Refresh failure cannot silently extend a subscription. |
| LIB-01 | Genuine PC entitlements | A controlled fixture corpus covers never-played purchases, expired subscriptions, console-only products and unknown access. No history-only or catalog-only record appears as purchased. Enumerate every page; incomplete paging shows "Partial library" with source/time. |
| LIB-02 | Distinguish purchase, subscription, none and unknown | Every row/detail has a textual access label. Unknown and none cannot install; expired subscription cannot install. Stale access requires refresh before a new install. Cache failure is not an empty library. |
| LIB-03 | Stale and partial inventory | Show age/source, last complete refresh and incomplete reason. Never replace a complete cached snapshot with a partial result without retaining explicit completeness metadata. An offline cached snapshot remains navigable but cannot authorize a new install. |
| FIND-01 | Library and Discover scoped search | Search field names the active scope. Identical queries can yield different results; changing tabs clears the query and never silently broadens to all catalog. Empty query, no match, network failure and loading have distinct copy. |
| ID-01 | Preserve product/edition/package identities | Two editions of a title remain selectable and distinct. Console package, unsupported architecture, language and market variants cannot be guessed. Package ID/version is pinned in an approved download plan; display title is never a registry key. |
| DETAIL-01 | Four independent facets | Access, downloadability, compatibility and local installation are always visible. Test purchased-but-unavailable, subscribable-but-unsupported, unknown compatibility, expired subscription and installed-with-revoked-access combinations. |
| COMPAT-01 | Evidence-scoped compatibility | Verified/experimental/unsupported/unknown include provenance, check time, OS, architecture and exact runtime fingerprint. OS/runtime mismatch invalidates "Verified"; historical reports are not verified. Experimental install requires an explicit warning acknowledgment per plan. |
| PLAN-01 | Review before downloading | Plan identifies edition/package/version, language, destination, download bytes, expanded bytes, staging/rollback overhead, required free bytes and paired runtime. Deny insufficient space; recheck immediately before reserving, and handle space lost mid-job. |
| QUEUE-01 | Durable, cancellable queue | Request IDs deduplicate repeated submission. App close/backend crash/power interruption at each download/verify/extract/register step restores the same job or an explicit recoverable error after restart. Zero completed installs are registered before integrity and atomic commit. |
| QUEUE-02 | Cancellation and recovery | Cancel is acknowledged once; staged files are removed within the allowed staging root, not saves or a runnable version. Late progress cannot resurrect a cancelled job. Disk/network/hash errors show a code and safe retry/re-plan action. Pause is offered only if negotiated. |
| PLAY-01 | Launch known installation | Launch checks registry, entitlement policy, evidence and exact runtime pairing. Missing runtime/files, offline policy denial and child-process failure are explicit errors. A launcher process spawn is not evidence of successful gameplay. |
| UPDATE-01 | Failure-safe version changes | Power loss or verification failure cannot remove the prior runnable version. Atomic registry promotion follows full verification. Rollback uses old package/runtime pair; saves live outside version directories. Test update failure and rollback after save modification. |
| REMOVE-01 | Safe removal | Preview installed content and saves separately. Default removal preserves saves; any separate save-deletion action requires explicit consent. Registry paths are validated, symlinks cannot escape managed roots, and unrelated user files survive tests. |
| SETTINGS-01 | Simple settings; advanced diagnostics | Account, storage and update policy are normal settings. Advanced exports redact tokens, signed URLs, account IDs and filesystem personal identifiers; exported content is previewed before sharing. Runtime options are the four user-directed presets in RUNTIME-01, not an unrestricted DLL selector. |
| RUNTIME-01 / RT-01..04 | CrossOver-first dependency and explicit experimental alternatives | Read-only approved publisher/bundle verification defaults only a new/unset profile to official CrossOver. Missing/unverified installation blocks gameplay setup, not catalog/account actions. Preserve explicit profiles; label GPTK/Wine/custom graphics Experimental and require acknowledgement that resets on changes. Identity is not licensing, device preflight or gameplay. No CrossOver redistribution or provider execution. Named neutral checks and trust source: [verification](VERIFICATION.md), [runtime policy](RUNTIME-PROVIDERS.md). |
| RUNTIME-02 | Independent components and isolated generations | Engine provenance/version/artifact identity and graphics backend/provenance/version/artifact identity are represented independently. A Wine 11 + D3DMetal 4 configuration is accepted as configuration, not verified gameplay. Changes to either component invalidate applicable evidence and require a new isolated prefix generation; no old bottle/save reuse, migration or deletion occurs silently. Versioned configuration negotiation must not silently rewrite management C95. |
| PARITY-01 | Independent account entitlement and Game Pass membership | A title may show both Owned and In Game Pass. Both filters include overlapping titles. Owned means held by the PC-library account; when acquisition kind is absent the app records Unknown and never claims a paid purchase. |
| PARITY-02 | Xbox game-service profile and achievements | Account-bound caches must match the current service account hash. Profile hides absent bio/location. Achievements use exact decimal title IDs, preserve earned/progress/G fields, and never present an incomplete page as complete. Recent play history never becomes ownership. |
| PARITY-03 | Consoles and remote-play handoff | Show only cached consoles actually returned by Xbox. Console IDs are never placed in URLs. Remote Play opens `https://www.xbox.com/remoteplay` in the default browser; Xodus provides no wake, power, install-to-console or native streaming command. |
| PARITY-04 | Dedicated Engines destination | Account, Settings and keyboard commands open one Engines page that reuses the governed runtime configuration UI. CrossOver observation, declared GPTK/Wine and graphics identities remain independent, and unsupported download/removal/runner actions stay absent. |

## SDD-LIB source acceptance

Frozen scope: R01/R03/R04/R05/R06 personal-library correctness, not the complete
43-row parity/release program. These are source/synthetic-check outcomes, **not
installed-product acceptance**. No GUI, sign-in, deployment or package issuance
is authorized by these statuses.

| Criterion | Source status and acceptance boundary |
| --- | --- |
| SDD-LIB-01 | Implemented: complete current account-held PC entries join installed or not; acquisition remains Unknown, never Purchased. |
| SDD-LIB-02 | Partial/contract blocked: overlapping held access and public PC catalog membership are distinct, both filters overlap. Game-Pass-only current account access cannot be established by the available scoped probe and partial public feed. It is not admitted by inference. |
| SDD-LIB-03 | Implemented under available evidence: public/local-only, console candidates, inactive/trial/expired collection rows and confirmed revoked/mismatched-account access are excluded. |
| SDD-LIB-04 | Implemented: unverified installed/imported records appear separately with a warning, never in Your Games counts or eligible hero/recent. Registry, game and save bytes are untouched. Existing protected Play/management routes remain reachable. |
| SDD-LIB-05 | Implemented: personal join drives counts/search/filter/sort and installed hero/Continue Playing; Store discovery remains separate. |
| SDD-LIB-06 | Implemented bounds; broader access contract pending: failed collection paging retains last-complete visibly stale representation, not install authorization. Account changes/revocation retire access. PC public feed loading/partial/failure is explicit; omissions do not revoke retained metadata. Cache is bounded to 512 public identities and existing market/language/disconnect boundaries. No subscription expiry completeness is claimed. |
| SDD-LIB-07 | Implemented source distinction: code 11 is package authorization/account-or-edition resolution, not unowned or Mac-unsupported. The package-check controller preserves prior compatibility/collection facts; code 12 remains separate. |
| SDD-LIB-08 | Unresolved: exact Launcher `9PGW18NPBZV5` and playable Windows `9NBLGGH2JHXJ` are distinct public identities; metadata is not access proof. Older `BZ8MZF8444Z5` has no observed PC SKU. No title-name substitution, new OAuth or broad licence experiments. Root owns further exact identity/access tracing. |

Focused neutral command: `swift run XodusPreview --library-access-check`.
It reaches the live `LibraryGame.collection`, local-record and presentation
selection seam plus `PCGamesController` with synthetic transport. Full native
checks additionally exercise public discovery failures and real controller
package-check failure paths using synthetic scripts.

**Observed neutral SDK 27 validation (9 October):** regression-first focused
test reproduced seven failures before the fix. Final source passed 104 focused
Library access checks, 15 core checks, 2,978 management checks, 172 preview
checks, 934 native-session checks, 152 native-host checks and 19 credential-wire
checks. Debug build and the shipping-configuration Release `XodusPreview`
compile passed without signing or packaging. The existing full `tools/check.sh`
gate stopped at the shipping test target because this Mac's Command Line Tools
SDK cannot resolve `XCTest`; that gate is **not PASS** and requires the existing
full-Xcode CI runner. No replacement test framework was introduced. These
synthetic/offscreen results are not a native installed walkthrough, genuine
Game-Pass-only authorization, Minecraft edition resolution or deployment.

**Exact missing backend evidence, not an invented schema:** an access response
must bind the account to the PC collection beneficiary/game-service identity
and retain exact product, selected SKU/package identity, access kind, observed
active/unresolved/revoked state, check time and source. Any declared expiry or
completeness needs authoritative evidence; absent fields stay unknown. The
existing global scoped licence probe cannot authorize every public catalog
tile or resolve Minecraft playable-edition access. No per-tile automatic
licence checks or guessed dates are introduced.

## Quality and inclusion gates

| ID | Requirement | Measurable acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A11Y-01 | Keyboard | Every action reachable using Tab/Shift-Tab with Full Keyboard Access; Command-1/2/3 navigate, Command-F focuses Search, Escape cancels a sheet without submitting, Command-comma opens Settings. Focus returns to initiating control. |
| A11Y-02 | VoiceOver | Game buttons read title + access + compatibility, four facets read in order, job changes are announced without repeating every percentage. Test onboarding, empty, detail, install confirmation, cancel and error recovery manually. |
| A11Y-03 | Contrast and preferences | Text reaches 4.5:1 (large 3:1), status is text + symbol, reduced transparency removes chrome dependence, reduced motion removes nonessential animation. All journeys usable in both appearances and increased contrast. |
| LAYOUT-01 | Resizing and text | At 820 x 600 through 1600 x 1000 points, no primary action clips, content scrolls and columns adapt. Test 30% text expansion, right-to-left reading and largest supported accessibility text settings. |
| I18N-01 | Localization | All production UI strings extracted to String Catalogs; byte/date/time formatting uses locale. Pseudolocalization and one RTL language have zero clipped controls; no title-based identifiers. English-only preview is labelled as such. |
| OFFLINE-01 | Useful but honest offline | Cached metadata and installed list load without network; unknown/stale access stays visible. No new install without approved fresh authorization. Launch offline only if the backend's signed policy permits it; never assume all owned games work offline. |
| PERF-01 | Responsiveness | Proposed target: cached 500-title library visible in <=2 s on minimum supported Mac; local search p95 <=100 ms; no main-thread operation >100 ms. Measure release builds with named fixture/hardware before adopting targets as guarantees. |
| PRIV-01 | Public/private separation | Automated source and diagnostic review finds zero real accounts, tokens, signed download URLs, private covers or private source. No TLS interception/proxy/purchase or credentials required for this foundation. |
| RELEASE-01 | Trust and distribution | Chosen licenses permit redistribution; signed/notarized app and signed, hash-verified version-paired runtime pass fresh-install, tamper, offline and rollback tests. No consumer release while ownership/API authorization remains unproven. |

## Prototype-specific acceptance

P-01: Visible "Fixture preview" notice in every main screen and sheets; no action is named simply "Install" or "Play" when it only simulates. P-02: No network clients, credentials, subprocess runtime adapter or package IO in the preview. P-03: `swift build`, `swift run XodusFixtureChecks`, and `swift run XodusPreview --self-check` pass on the isolated Mac tooling directory (no XCTest/Testing dependency; those frameworks are absent from the tested CLT). P-04: original Library, Discover/Search, detail/install, Downloads, onboarding, blocked and error SVGs are editable and reproducible. P-05: one public durable branch and one draft PR, no merge.
